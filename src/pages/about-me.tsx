          Hi, my name is <strong>Davide Imola</strong>, and I am a young DevOps Engineer. I have a strong advocation towards Cloud-Native architectures, serverless infrastructure, and automation.
          <br/><br/>
          I am currently working as a DevOps Engineer at milkman and studying Cyber Security at Verona University, Italy.

          In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies and series, listen to music, read some books (maybe I would read more than now üòÖ), play video games, stay with Lord (my dog, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel üê∂) and travel around the world. Moreover, I am a newbie amatorial photographer.
