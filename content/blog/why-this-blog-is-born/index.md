Ciao! I will welcome you in the first post of my blog. I can think what you are asking for, why this blog is can be useful to me? Seriously, I do not know ðŸ˜…, but I can explain to you why I am writing this blog.

I have decided to start this adventure, not for money or celebrity, but for the reason to improve my self and maybe the others.

I am a young Italian software engineer and I have so many things to learn. So I want to share my research here.

Furthermore, I have decided to write everything in English, because it is one of the most spoken languages in the world, and I want to improve it.
